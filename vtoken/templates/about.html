            <p>Over the past few years, as we know Blockchain technology has enabled a new software paradigm for managing digital ownership in partial trust environments</p>
            <p>In this application, we use the Blockchain concept which generates tokens. The System generated tokens are used as loyalty points which are generated by the concept of Token generation in cryptocurrency and managed by the blockchain. It is used in an organization or institutes where the students can redeem points or use them as a regular currency in transactions. Tokens or loyalty points can be redeemed within the campus as well for transactions or utilize to enroll in digital courses and to achieve coordination across organizations. If a student completes a task then the student will be rewarded with the tokens as a token of appreciation, tokens are awarded to the students as they progress through the defined milestones by the faculty. And as a reward, When a student Wins any competition or contest. This streamlines the reward system of students and helps to create value for the generated tokens. All these transactions of tokens are managed in the wallet. The wallet holds all the system-generated tokens and rewarded tokens. Fundamental to this representation is that users can independently control token custody in digital wallets and interact with one another in a peer-to-peer manner. And we can say it is a distributed ledger that records and secures transactions in a peer-to-peer network. These networks provide secure transaction linkage, and storage in integrity-protected distributed ledgers forming mutually operated record-keeping execution environments.</p>
